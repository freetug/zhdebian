    <p style="color: #AAA; text-align: left; font-size: 0.8em;"><em>by Jon Beltran de Heredia, May 16th, 2007</em></p>

      <p>Yes, even if you can't believe it, there are a lot fans of the
      30-years-old <strong>vi</strong> editor (or its more recent, just-15-years-old,
      best clone &amp; great improvement, <strong>vim</strong>).</p>

      <p>No, they are not dinosaurs who don't want to catch up with the times -
      the community of vi users just keeps growing: myself, I only got started 2
      years ago (after over 10 years of being a professional programmer). Friends of
      mine are converting today. Heck, most vi users were not even born when vi was
      written!</p>

      <p>Yes, there are definite reasons why the vi/vim editing model is just
      superior to any other out there. And you don't need to be a Unix whiz to use
      it, either: <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> is available for free
      for almost any platform out there, and there are plug-ins to get the
      functionality inside all major IDEs. Let's try to break a few
      misconceptions, and see some real examples of why it's the killerest:</p>

  <h3>Misconception #1: modal editing</h3>

      <p>The first time you stumble into vi or vim, you are shocked and disgusted
      that you have to use 'i' to start typing text. Can't remember which of hjkl
      moves in which direction. And you need to press 'a' if you want to insert after
      the last character of the line. Since you're already probably used to other
      editors, and if the arrow keys work in insert mode (they do if the system is
      configured properly, which is over 90% of the cases), you will stay in insert
      mode and not go back to normal mode except if absolutely necessary. You'll
      probably spend 20 minutes with it, and never go back. And also complaining: <a
      href="http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/religion/vi-tutorial.html">"How on earth
      am I going to remember whether I'm in insert or normal mode?"</a></p>

      <p>Turns out, this is just a <em>completely wrong</em> way to use vi or vim.
      Using vi/vim properly, you don't use it modally. You are <em>always</em> in
      normal mode, and only enter insert mode for <em>short bursts</em> of typing
      text, after which you press &lt;Esc&gt; to go to normal mode. Thus, the
      remembering-the-mode problem just doesn't exist: you don't answer the phone in
      insert mode to get back to vi and not remember where you were. If you are
      typing text and the phone rings, you exit insert mode and then answer the phone. Or
      you press &lt;Esc&gt; when you come back. But you never think about insert mode
      as a mode where you <em>stay</em>.</p>

      <p>Let me explain the philosophy behind this.</p>

      <p>Commands in vi/vim are meant to be combined - 'd' means delete, 'e'
      means 'move to end of word', then 'de' is a complete command that deletes to
      the end of the current word (something like Ctrl-Shift-Right, Left, Del in most
      regular editors).</p>

      <p>One good benefit of this is that the '.' command repeats the last
      <em>complete</em>, <em>combined</em> editing command (not movement commands).
      After doing 'dw', '.' will act as a command to delete to the beginning of the
      next word. You can move around at will with all the powerful navigation
      commands, and press '.' at will to delete to the next word quickly. This turns
      out to be incredibly powerful.</p>

      <p>And now we come to insert commands. These commands enter insert mode and let
      you type text until you press &lt;Esc&gt;. Ok, in the case of these commands,
      the full command includes all the text you typed between 'i' (or whatever
      command you used to enter insert mode, as there are several) and
      &lt;Esc&gt;.</p>

      <p>What this means is that if you type 'iHello&lt;Esc&gt;', which enters the
      text 'Hello' at the cursor's position, what now '.' does is "Type 'Hello' at
      the cursor's position". All of it. And you can understand that is pretty
      powerful. But it's better than this. 'A' goes to the end of the current line
      and enters insert mode there. So, after completing the insert by pressing
      &lt;Esc&gt;, you can press '.' anywhere to go to the end of the line and do the
      same thing.</p>

      <p>One other even more powerful example: let's take the 'ce' command, which is
      composed of 'c' and 'e'. The 'c'hange command deletes the range specified by
      the next motion command, and also enters insert mode. It's the same as 'd', but
      with the distinction that it enters insert mode, instead of staying in normal
      mode. The boon is that the text you type in the next (short) input session is
      also part of the command. So if you do 'ceHello&lt;Esc&gt>', what you do
      is replace from the cursor to the end of the word by 'Hello', and the '.'
      command afterwards will work exactly like that: replace up to the end of the
      word with 'Hello'.</p>

      <p>Motions (cursor-moving commands) can also get more complex, and there are all sorts of
      insert-mode-entering commands ('o' to create a new line below, 'O' to enter one
      above, 'S' to delete to the end of line, etc... all of them entering insert mode
      afterwards) so you can imagine what type of powerful editing mini-ops you can
      build and repeat with simple '.'s!</p>

  <h3>Example #1: the wonderful dot command</h3>

      <p>Let's see a concrete example. Say you have declared three new functions in
      your header file, and you need to implement them in the module. You copy the
      following text and paste it into your implementation file:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-1-1.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>All code starts like this, doesn't it?</em>
            </center>

      <p>Now you have to remove their semicolons, and adding an empty body would be a
      good idea. With the cursor as above, you can use 'A' to go straight into insert
      mode at the end of the line:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-1-2.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>After 'A' - see the insert mode cursor (vertical line) at the end</em>
            </center>

      <p>Now you delete the semicolon with &lt;backspace&gt;:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-1-3.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Deleting is simple</em>
            </center>

      <p>And type &lt;return&gt; { &lt;return&gt; } &lt;return&gt; to insert the body:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-1-4.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Inserting too, as in any other editor</em>
            </center>

      <p>And finally, type &lt;Esc&gt; to return to normal mode:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-1-5.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>And now, quickly!, we return to normal mode</em>
            </center>

      <p>And now you have to repeat this with the other two. How do you do it? Easy:
      first, press 'j' to move the cursor down. And then, press '.' to repeat the last
      full editing command (the 'A' command with the backspace and the inserted text).
      If you do 'j.j.', that is, twice, you get the following:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-1-6.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Just j.j. to do this!</em>
            </center>

      <p>The vi command architecture was key here, together with the fact that
      &lt;backspace&gt; is as part of the editing sequence as regular typing, and the
      editing operations being pretty repetitive. But think about it, how much of
      your daily editing is repetitive? Yeah, I thought so.</p>

  <h3>Misconception #2: it's not all about regular expressions</h3>

      <p>Vi/vim is pretty powerful handling regular expressions. All half-serious
      editors have regular expression support for searching, replacing, etc, but only
      vi (that I know) can use them in highly complex ways, such as doing a certain
      regex search and replace in the second occurrence of 'begin' after lines that
      contain 'proc', or whatever you think up.</p>

      <p>So this is not to demean the power of regexes, or the vi/vim regex-using
      power. But the main power of vi, and the power that you can't live without
      after you've got used to it, is the power of the basic editing model:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>One- or two-key motions to move directly anywhere on the line, or on the
        screen</li>

        <li>Operators such as 'd' or 'c' that can be combined with any motion to
        directly modify some text and maybe enter insert mode, and being able to repeat
        it all as many times as you wish with '.'</li>

        <li>Anything can be done without moving your hands away from home row! No more
        suffering when editing on a laptop with a braindead keyboard layout (most of
        them)</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Example #2: smart ranges</h3>

      <p>Let's see the following typical example. It's just a function call embedded
      in a somewhat complex expression:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-2-1.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Complex expression and function call</em>
            </center>

      <p>As you see, we have the cursor positioned at the start of the call. Now
      imagine that we want to extract this and assign it to a local variable. The
      first part is selecting the relevant call, then copying and deleting it to move
      above, typing the var name, and moving above to type the declaration. In
      regular editing models, you will play hunt-and-peck with Ctrl-Right and
      left/right until you get it exactly right. Not with vi or vim. The '%' motion
      moves from a parenthesis (or similar grouping character) to its matching one -
      but if you're not positioned at one of these special characters, it will scan
      character by character to the right, until the first one is found, and then
      moving to the character matching that one. So, in the above situation, it will
      move to the right closing parenthesis!</p>

      <p>Knowing about the 'c' command, which deletes the extents of the next motion
      (also copying it to the clipboard) and enters insert mode, we can type just
      'c%' ("change match") from the above case and we get the following:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-2-2.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>After just 'c%' ("change match")</em>
            </center>

      <p>The relevant call has gone to the clipboard, and we're also ready to type
      the name of the variable. Not bad for just two keystrokes! After typing the
      variable name and pressing &lt;Esc&gt; to go back to normal mode, it will look
      like this:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-2-3.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Typing and &lt;Esc&gt;</em>
            </center>

      <p>Now in normal mode, you can type 'O' to open a new line above the
      current one and enter insert mode, and start typing the declaration:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-2-4.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Just pressed 'O' and typed the start of the declaration</em>
            </center>

      <p>And now, when we have to insert the previous expression, since we have
      it in the clipboard, we can use Ctrl-R, &quot; to paste it in insert mode
      (admittedly a bit unintuitive to remember, but it's the key to simple
      multiple-clipboard support). This will bring in the function call we deleted at the
      previous point. So Ctrl-R, &quot;, we type a semicolon, and &lt;Esc&gt; to get back
      to insert mode gest us here:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-2-5.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Finished!</em>
            </center>

  <h3>Misconception #3: you gotta be nuts and/or a genius to use it</h3>

      <p>Well, I hope that with the above explanations and examples, you have already
      seen some of the power that vi/vim provides. Learning it is tough (see below),
      but if you're going to be editing code 8 hours or more a day for years, it's
      the second best investment after learning touch typing (which you already know,
      right? If not, don't bother with vi, learn that first). A learning curve of
      weeks make sense for such a lifetime investment. And, at least, you won't have
      a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/marigan/entry/how_the_vi_editor_would">dumb
      assistant</a> to annoy you to death.</p>

      <p>The point is, with vi, your keyboard becomes a huge specialized text-editing
      gamepad with almost a hundred buttons. Each of them has at least two functions,
      shifted and unshifted, so you have almost two hundred functions at a single
      keypress (not counting Shift). Commands are incredibly powerful for text
      editing, and you can even combine them to obtain the best results. While typing
      some text, it is a regular keyboard, but when you're back to normal mode you
      have the best-designed text-editing machine there is, and it shows.</p>

  <h3>Example #3: manipulating delimited blocks</h3>

      <p>One other simple example. This one only works with vim (uses one of vim's
      specific motions). Say you are inside an angle-bracketed section, as is so
      common in these days of XML:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-3-1.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Life at an XML tag...</em>
            </center>

      <p>How do you select the text inside for copying/deleting/modifying it? In
      regular editors, once again, you have to move your hands off their current,
      comfortable position, and go for the arrow keys or, even worse, the mouse. 
      Any of those is probably a pain, especially when working on a laptop. How
      do you do it in vim? You just use one of the text-object motions, which all
      start with 'i' or 'a' (they can only be used after an operator like 'd' or
      'c'). 'i&gt;' refers to "the current 'i'nner angle bracket block", so you can
      do 'di&gt;' ("delete inner angle-block") to just delete all the contents from
      the above situation:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-3-2.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>After typing di&gt; ("delete inner angle-block")</em>
            </center>

      <p>You can use '(' or ')' for the current parenthesized block (or even 'b' from
      'b'lock), '[' or ']', '{' or '}', 'w' for punctuation-delimited-word, or 'W'
      for the current space-delimited word, prepending 'i' to any of them for
      the 'inside' contents, or 'a' to include the delimiting characters too.</p>

  <h3>Misconception #4: hjkl to move around?</h3>

      <p>Many people find it weird to use hjkl instead of arrow keys for moving
      around. The actual reason for this implementation seems to be that
      terminals of the time didn't reliably have arrow keys, and that <a
      href="http://www.tentacle.franken.de/adm3a/">this terminal</a> in particular
      had <a href="http://www.tentacle.franken.de/adm3a/adm3a-hjkl.jpg">hjkl keys
      doubling as cursor keys</a>. But the side effect is that you don't need to move
      your hands off the home row to move around, which is great.</p>

      <p>But in any case, although you will use hjkl to move around at first, once
      you master vi/vim you probably won't use 'h' and 'l' ('left' and 'right') at
      all, and you will use 'j' and 'k' sparingly. Why is that? Because there are
      other, more powerful motions, that will often get you where you want to go much
      faster. When moving inside a line, I find that there is always a motion to take
      me straight to where I want to go, so I use those motions: 'f' followed by any
      other character to find its next occurrence, '%' to use matching parens to go
      where you want to go, etc... When navigating the file, you have motions to go to
      the top/middle/bottom of the screen directly, '/' which is effortless to type
      to search for a string, ']]' and the likes to navigate by functions, etc.</p>

  <h3>Example #4: nice commands</h3>

      <p>Some commands are just so useful that you would miss them if you knew them.
      'H', 'M' and 'L' take the cursor directly to the 'H'ighest, 'M'iddle, or
      'L'ower line on the screen. 'zt', 'zz' and 'zb' keep the cursor at the current
      position, but scroll the view so that it falls at the 't'op, 'z' center, or
      'b'ottom of the screen. '*' searches forward for the next occurrence of the
      word under the cursor ('#' does the same backwards, at symmetrical positions so
      its easier to remember). And there are dozens more...</p>

  <h3>Misconception #5: since you are thinking 90% of the time, and editing 10%, the productivity gain might be there, but it's useless anyway</h3>

      <p>Well, those are exaggerated figures, but this fact is often mentioned
      against any editing gains being important to development productivity. I'll
      wager that this is wrong.</p>

      <p>First thing, in the chances where I really have to think a problem, and
      there is no need to look at code, I pick my bike and go for a one hour ride.
      Or a two hour ride. At least if the weather is good. It's much nicer than
      staying in front of the computer.</p>

      <p>Also, when I have to analyze some hard problem and design a solution, I
      often bring out a notebook (a real notebook, made of paper with cardboard
      covers and bound with a spiral), and a pen, and try to clarify my thoughts
      there.</p>

      <p>You can bet that, with a few exceptions, productive work can't be done away
      from the computer. This is because, most of the time, you have to look at the
      code to think and design. And this involves navigating the code with an editor.
      And also, very often, you *are* indeed typing or editing continuously. You
      maybe just think for 1 minute, but then you spend one other full minute editing
      the changes you just thought about. And when you are editing, you want to
      have the best damn tool for the job.</p>

      <p>Comfortable editing helps you stay in "the zone", the state of concentration
      that gets you the maximum productivity. As you master a powerful tool such as an
      editor, it just disappears from your conscious, and you are free to
      concentrate in the problem, and your editing happens unconsciously. Regular
      editing makes you hunt-and-peck, use Ctrl-Right, Ctrl-Right, Ctrl-Right,
      Ctrl-Right, Ctrl-Right to get to where you want to go, it makes you move your
      hand to your mouse, open a menu, select an option, enter stuff into a dialog
      and click 'Ok' to accept it. In vi/vim most stuff is a surprisingly small
      number of keystrokes away, in a direct fashion.</p>

      <p>Other vi users have also shared this with me, so I know I'm not alone in the
      feeling: once you start to master vi, there are times in which, after finishing
      a 30-second-long full-steam editing session, you kind of 'wake-up' to a faint
      memory of the sound of a continuous stream of keystrokes. It feels like you
      have been hearing them in the back of your head while you were dicing and
      slicing lines of text, blocks, motions and modifications. And this during this
      period of editing, you are feeling a tremendous sensation of power.</p>

  <h3>Example #5: indenting a block</h3>

      <p>Vi and vim know your code has some structure. Many of the commands reflect
      this. Say 'aB', as described in example #3 above: it selects the current '{'
      and '}' delimited block, including the braces themselves ('a}' does the same).
      And let's take it and combine with the '&gt;' operator, a useful operator that
      indents the region indicated by the next motion. Picture the following
      code:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-5-1.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Improperly indented</em>
            </center>

      <p>How often do you encounter such a case? Yes, you can paste with auto-reindent
      (just ']p' in vim), but often you forget to, or you reach this case not because
      of pasting the block, but because you added or removed stuff above. You just have
      to indent it a bit, and you'll be done. In other editors, you move around, you
      select, you type TAB or the shortcut to auto-indent. Not so with vim, just
      three keystrokes: '&gt;aB' ("indent a Block") and you get this:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-5-2.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>We didn't even have to move the cursor!</em>
            </center>

      <p>How cool is that? You didn't move or select, you just told it directly what
      you wanted to do, and it did it. I believe it's this type of "straight" editing
      that gives you the feeling of power and helps you enter and stay in <a
      href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">"the
      zone"</a>.</p>

  <h3>Misconception #6: it's just sticking to a disappearing past</h3>

      <p>Vi has been around for 30 years, and it's still there. Vim, a full-vi-clone
      which introduces even more improvements than vi has features, has been
      alive and kicking for 15 years, available for free on almost every single
      platform on earth. People who love vi have found a way to use it everywhere:
      there is <a href="http://www.satokar.com/viplugin/">a plug-in to get vi
      emulation in Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.corsofamily.net/jcorso/vi/">a
      plug-in to get vi emulation in many Mac OS X apps</a>, <a
      href="http://ideavim.sourceforge.net/">a plug-in to add vi emulation to
      IntelliJ IDEA</a>, even Emacs has not one, <a
      href="http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/RZ/software/emacs/viper/viper_toc.html">but</a> <a
      href="http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/RZ/software/emacs/vip/vip_toc.html">several</a>
      built-in vi emulators (when I end up tinkering lisp code in emacs, I start by
      trying to use emacs keybindings, and always end up typing "M-x viper-mode"), I
      develop and sell <a href="http://www.viemu.com">ViEmu</a>, a family of
      plug-ins to get vi/vim emulation in Visual Studio, SQL Server, Word and
      Outlook, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a> still uses it for
      his lisp and arc hacking, <a
      href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/1999/unix_editor.html">Tim
      O'Reilly</a> is a confessed vi-er, <a href="http://www.slickedit.com">SlickEdit</a> and <a
      href="http://www.crisp.com">Crisp</a> have vi emulation...</p>

      <p>Of course, the vi/vim community is not a majority: most computer users
      are not even touch-typists, and vi adds yet another steep learning curve. Those
      who have seen the light, though, won't go back to other, poorer, editing
      systems - so vi/vim editing is guaranteed to survive for many years to come.
      Actually, using vi(m) keybindings is probably the closest you can get to ensure
      you have it available in any environment you are or will be in the future, from
      old Unix systems to the latest popular IDE.</p>

  <h3>Example #6: visual nature</h3>

      <p>And as a final example, even if it seems vi is just about cryptic and
      unreadable commands, we are going to see some of the more visual aspects
      (actually, they are vim features, rather than vi original ones). One of them:
      with 'hlsearch' enabled (off by default in vim, but easily enabled with ":set
      hlsearch"), when you search for a string, all its matches are highlighted on
      the screen. Say you have the following html code:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-6-1.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Some html source</em>
            </center>

      <p>If you press '*', the word under the cursor ('div') is searched for. It results in this:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-6-2.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Powerful asterisk!</em>
            </center>

      <p>As you see, the cursor has moved, and the different occurrences are conveniently highlighted.</p>

      <p>Let's see some more. We've seen operators like 'd' and 'c' act upon the
      region given by the next command. Well, if we want visual feedback, we can use
      visual mode: press 'v', move around while you see the region from the initial
      point highlighted, and then press the operator directly to see its effect.
      Search commands work here as well. If you use 'V' instead of 'v', highlighting
      will be done by lines. Let's press 'V' and then 'k' (up) after the above:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-6-3.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>After Vk ("visual-lines, up")</em>
            </center>

      <p>As you see, the two lines are highlighted as selected. Say we want to select
      until the closing div tag (the search highlight shows it). Type 'N' (previous
      match), and we get the following:</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-6-4.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>After 'N' ("previous-match")</em>
            </center>

      <p>And now we can do whatever we want, say, the 'gU' operator to make everything upper-case
      (and return to normal mode):</p>

            <center>
            <img src="why-vi-img/why-vi-6-5.gif" alt=""/>
            </center>
            <center class="smalltext">
            <em>Lovely upper case</em>
            </center>

      <p>And now, let's just go for a correct common 'conception' about vi/vim:</p>

  <h3>Correct-conception #1: steep learning curve</h3>

      <p>There is one thing which is a commonly held piece of knowledge, and which is
      true as well. It is shown <a
      href="http://www.bemroses.net/images/curves.jpg">on this page</a> to
      the best effect. It's the fact that learning vi/vim is an activity that will
      take a long time (weeks to months), and that the first experience is not
      pleasant. I take it this is the main reason why vi/vim editing isn't, and will
      never be, a popular thing. You need to invest quite some effort to learn,
      memorize, and internalize the 30 or so commands that start making you more
      productive than with other editors. Since they're all arbitrary one-key
      commands (although all of them have some easy mnemonic to aid in remembering
      them, and even some form of coherence), this is not an easy task. It's easy to
      throw in the towel and go back to familiar jedit or pico, ultraedit or textmate,
      or even emacs. But once the effort to learn it has been made, I know of no one who
      goes back. And I know dozens of people that have told me that they've
      been using 'vi' for over 10 years, and that they're accustomed to and expecting
      even the smallest details.</p>

  <h3>Closing words</h3>

      <p>Do whatever you want. Don't learn it if you feel it's too much effort just
      for nothing. Learn emacs instead. Or stay in your IDE using a lousy editor.
      Whatever. But in any case, don't ever claim again that those 'vi guys are
      nutheads' - I hope that I have succeeded in showing you why they
      (<em>we</em>) stick to it, and you should at least be able to understand its
      power, even if you prefer to stay away from it.</p>
